            <marquee>The recent attacks on unarmed students by political workers and the police in Bangladesh are an alarming development that warrants independent investigation, writes Scroll.in.

                    The Indian news site called it ‘organic demonstrations’ that “grew into a peaceful civil disobedience movement, bringing the Bangladesh capital to a halt and spreading to other parts of the country.”
                    
                    After the protests continued for a week, alleged cadres of the ruling Awami League assaulted the unarmed protestors as well as journalists who were documenting the attacks, said a Scroll.in article referring to Human Rights Watch.
                    
                    The protests followed the death of two students on 29 July when a speeding bus ran them over in Dhaka city. The young student protesters demanded road safety.
                    
                    In the article ‘Bangladesh has damaged its democratic credentials with the latest crackdown’, Scroll.in said the crackdown on the protestors lasted for days and left hundreds injured.

                <p>
                    As many as 12 student bodies have formed a new alliance named Santrasbirodhi Chhatraoikya (United Students Against Terrorism) to fight terrorists and communal and autocratic forces in the educational institutions.
                </p>
                <p>Representatives of the 12 organisations announced the formation of the platform at a press conference at Madhur Canteen on Dhaka University campus on Friday.</p>
                <p>
                    The alliance comprises of Bangladesh Chhatra Union, Bangladesh Chhatra Federation (Ganasanghati Andolon), Bangladesh Chhatra Federation (Badruddin Umar), Samajtantrik Chhatra Front (BSD), Samajtantrik Chhatra Front (Marxist), Biplobi Chhatra Moitree, Biplobi Chhatra-Juba Andolon, Brihattar Parbatya Chattagram Pahari Chhatra Parishad, Nagorik Chhatra Oikya, Satantra Jote and Chhatra Ganamancha.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Floating the alliance, Dhaka University Central Student Union’s (DUCSU) social affairs secretary Akhter Hossain put forward a four-point demand.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These are: legal action and permanent expulsion of the students who attacked DUCSU vice-president Nurul Haq and other students, removal of DU proctor Golam Rabbani for failing to protect students from the attack, withdrawal of cases against VP Nurul and other students.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Their other demands include ensuring a democratic environment and safety of the students on the campuses and ending the culture of persecuting students in the guest room in residential halls.
                </p>
                <p>
                    DUCSU vice president Nurul Haq and around 20 others came under an attack allegedly by the activists of Bangladesh Chhatra League and Muktijuddha Mancha on Sunday.
                </p>
                <p>
                    BCL is the student wing of ruling Awami League.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Akhter, who is also a leader of VP Nurul’s student organisation Bangladesh General Students' Rights Protection Council (BGSRPC), in his written speech alleged that DU proctor abetted ruling party student wing BCL and Muktijuddha Mancha to launch the attack.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Saying that the students have no right to express dissent on campuses, Akhter said, “BUET student Abrar Fahad was mercilessly beaten to death by Chhatra League cadres for expressing his views.”
                </p>
